The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a basic full-stack application into a functional web-based crawler management system. Initially, the codebase lacked any crawler functionality, which was identified and addressed by building a system from scratch. The development trajectory was heavily influenced by iterative user feedback, particularly regarding the specific login sequence (师门 button selection before credentials).

A significant portion of the work involved troubleshooting environment setup on macOS (Homebrew, network issues, MongoDB installation) and refining Selenium-based web interaction for accurate element targeting. The final iteration implemented a precise login flow for the target website, incorporating multiple robust strategies for element identification. Due to environmental challenges, the MongoDB integration was initially bypassed, opting for in-memory data storage, which simplifies deployment. The system now features one-click deployment/update scripts and a user-friendly React frontend.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement persistent data storage (e.g., re-integrate MongoDB or switch to another database) instead of current in-memory storage.
-   Implement actual scheduled crawling (e.g., using APScheduler or a cron-like mechanism) rather than manual trigger via a start button.
-   Add robust error handling for network issues and anti-bot mechanisms during the actual crawl.
-   Integrate multi-account concurrent crawling as originally specified.
-   Add account management UI for adding/deleting accounts.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The current state of the product is an in-memory, M4-optimized web-based crawler management system. The primary focus in the recent interactions was to precisely implement the 师门 (guild) login flow based on user's detailed clarification and an actual screenshot of the target login page.

**Backend ()**:
-   The core crawler logic is encapsulated in the  class.
-   The  method has been heavily refined to accurately interact with the login page:
    -   It first navigates to the target URL ().
    -   It employs multiple robust strategies (e.g., XPath with exact text , , , and general button targeting) to locate and click the 师门 button.
    -   After selecting the login type, it identifies and fills the username and password fields using various CSS selectors to ensure flexibility.
    -   Finally, it finds and clicks the 登录 (login) button using similar multi-strategy approaches.
    -   Extensive logging has been added to trace each step of the login process, aiding in debugging.
-   Data is currently stored in global in-memory lists (, ), meaning data will be lost on server restart.
-   API endpoints exist for starting the crawler, fetching account/data, generating mock data, testing the optimized login, checking status, and exporting CSV.

**Frontend ()**:
-   The React UI has been updated to reflect the v2.1 optimized version with enhanced styling (gradients, shadows, custom icons for stats).
-   It provides buttons to 启动师门爬虫 (start crawler demo), 生成演示数据 (generate mock data), and 导出CSV.
-   A specific 🎯 师门登录优化测试 button is available for each account in the 账号管理 section, allowing users to test the refined login flow.
-   The UI displays system version, update date, and a changelog for the optimizations.
-   Data fetching is done via  calls to the backend APIs, and displayed in a tabular format.

The most recent work involved providing and executing a  script to deploy these login optimizations and UI improvements. The logs indicate successful browser driver setup, but the ultimate success of the login process depends on the exact structure of the target website and whether the new precise selectors work.
